<h2>Week 8 – Testing & Evaluation</h2>
<p>With the project finished, students mount or hold their hose holders and test them. They hang a coil of hose to see if the holder supports the weight without bending, check that the hose sits securely and doesn’t slip off, and ensure the holder is stable when attached. Students time how long it takes to coil and uncoil the hose and gather peer feedback about ease of use. They evaluate their work against the criteria set during Week 2: function, strength, safety, durability and aesthetics. Students also reflect on what went well and what could be improved.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>Jenny’s holder holds a standard hose well but bends slightly under a very heavy coil. She notes that using thicker metal or adding a support strut could improve it. Michael’s holder wobbles because the frame sticks out too far from the wall; he considers adding a second attachment point. Both students listen to peer feedback suggesting small improvements like adding a hook for the nozzle. They conclude that while their holders work, version 2 could be even better.</p>
<h3>Quiz</h3>
<form class="quiz-form" data-unit="8" aria-label="Quiz">
<p>1. If Jenny’s holder bends slightly under a heavy load, what should she conclude?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="A" required> A. It meets the need for typical use but may need thicker metal or extra support for very heavy hoses</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="B" required> B. It has completely failed and is useless</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="C" required> C. Bending is fine and not worth noting</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="D" required> D. She should never use it with a hose</label>
<br>
<p>2. What improvement did Michael think of to reduce wobble?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="A" required> A. Adding a second wall attachment point</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="B" required> B. Removing material to make it lighter</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="C" required> C. Bending it more upward</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="D" required> D. Painting it again</label>
<br>
<p>3. Why is peer feedback useful during evaluation?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="A" required> A. Others might notice issues or have ideas you didn’t think of</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="B" required> B. It isn’t useful; only the creator knows the design</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="C" required> C. To find someone to blame</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="D" required> D. Peers aren’t experts so their opinions don’t matter</label>
<br>
<p>4. Which of these questions is NOT relevant when evaluating your project?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="A" required> A. Does it fulfil the purpose?</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="B" required> B. What grade will I get?</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="C" required> C. How well did I follow my design and could it be improved?</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="D" required> D. Is it safe and durable?</label>
<br>
<p>5. How might you test how easily a hose coils and uncoils on your holder?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="A" required> A. Actually coil and uncoil a hose a few times and note how smooth it is</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="B" required> B. Just imagine it and assume it works</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="C" required> C. Roll a rope instead</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="D" required> D. Ignore that criterion</label>
<br>
<p>6. Part of evaluation is thinking “If I built this again, what would I do differently?”</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="A" required> A. True – reflection helps you improve</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="B" required> B. False – you shouldn’t change anything</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="C" required> C. Only the teacher needs to reflect</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="D" required> D. Reflection is a waste of time</label>
<br>
<p>7. Which of these is a good evaluation comment?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="A" required> A. The holder meets the need; it’s strong enough for a 15 m hose. Next time I’d make the hook wider for thick hoses.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="B" required> B. It’s fine I guess</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="C" required> C. My project has no flaws</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="D" required> D. I don’t know</label>
<br>
<p>8. Who is the end‑user you should consider when evaluating your holder?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="A" required> A. A homeowner or gardener who needs to store a hose</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="B" required> B. Just the teacher</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="C" required> C. No one in particular</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="D" required> D. The manufacturer</label>
<br>
<p>9. When testing your hose holder, which of the following is least critical and could reasonably be checked last?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="A" required> A. Whether the holder supports the weight of a full hose</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="B" required> B. Whether the hose sits securely and doesn’t slip</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="C" required> C. How easy it is to coil and uncoil the hose</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="D" required> D. The exact colour shade of the paint you used</label>
<br>
<p>10. Why does the syllabus emphasise doing an evaluation and reflection?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="A" required> A. It helps consolidate what you learned and mirrors real design practice</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="B" required> B. It just fills time at the end of term</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="C" required> C. To find flaws and make you feel bad</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="D" required> D. It isn’t important at all</label>
