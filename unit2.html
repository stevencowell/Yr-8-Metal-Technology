<h2>Week 2 – Design & Planning</h2>
<p>In Week 2 students follow the design process: investigate, ideate and plan. They research existing hose holders, brainstorm several different concepts and decide on the best idea by comparing how well each meets the criteria. Once a concept is chosen, they draw detailed plans with dimensions, compile a list of materials, and write a step‑by‑step production plan. Planning ahead saves time and materials later; the old saying ‘measure twice, cut once’ applies. Students learn to adjust designs to suit available tools and resources.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>Jordan drew a quick sketch for his holder and said he would figure out the rest later. He forgot to include a mounting plate, so when it came time to assemble he had no way to attach the holder to the wall. Sam, however, explored several designs, made a cardboard model to test the size, and wrote out a list of materials and steps. Her project came together smoothly. This case shows how careful planning prevents problems.</p>
<h3>Quiz</h3>
<form class="quiz-form" data-unit="2" aria-label="Quiz">
<p>1. In the case study, what planning misstep led to Jordan’s inability to mount his holder?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="A" required> A. He brainstormed too many possible designs</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="B" required> B. He failed to include a mounting plate or attachment method in his plan</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="C" required> C. He took the safety test too late</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="D" required> D. He chose the wrong material</label>
<br>

<p>2. During the ideation phase, which practice leads to a more robust design?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="A" required> A. Stick with the first idea to save time</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="B" required> B. Sketch and explore multiple concepts before selecting the best one</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="C" required> C. Copy someone else’s design exactly</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="D" required> D. Avoid looking at existing solutions</label>
<br>

<p>3. Which of these is the most critical design criterion for the hose holder?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="A" required> A. It must support the weight of a coiled garden hose without deforming</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="B" required> B. It needs to be painted bright red</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="C" required> C. It should cost more than $100 to make</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="D" required> D. It should be as complex as possible</label>
<br>

<p>4. Why is building a cardboard model valuable during planning?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="A" required> A. It’s a waste of time because cardboard isn’t metal</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="B" required> B. It lets you cheaply test proportions and fit before cutting metal</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="C" required> C. Cardboard is stronger than steel so it’s a better material</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="D" required> D. Teachers grade the model instead of the real project</label>
<br>

<p>5. To ensure your design can be mounted securely, what must you include?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="A" required> A. Decorative patterns and logos</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="B" required> B. A mounting plate or brackets with properly sized screw holes</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="C" required> C. Extra hooks for storing tools</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="D" required> D. Nothing – it will stick on its own</label>
<br>

<p>6. Which activity best demonstrates the TE4‑1DP outcome of designing and evaluating?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="A" required> A. Completing the safety quiz on time</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="B" required> B. Developing a creative idea, producing detailed drawings and later evaluating how well it meets the brief</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="C" required> C. Cutting metal perfectly on the first try</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="D" required> D. Memorising the periodic table of elements</label>
<br>

<p>7. If your design calls for a process that your school cannot accommodate, what should you do?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="A" required> A. Insist on using the unavailable process anyway</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="B" required> B. Adapt your design to use joining or shaping methods that are available</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="C" required> C. Abandon the project entirely</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="D" required> D. Secretly fabricate it at home without supervision</label>
<br>

<p>8. Why does the saying “measure twice, cut once” apply during planning?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="A" required> A. Double‑checking measurements up front saves material and time later</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="B" required> B. It means you should cut every component twice</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="C" required> C. It only applies when working with timber</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="D" required> D. It isn’t important in metalwork</label>
<br>

<p>9. Which of the following would not appear in a well‑prepared production plan?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="A" required> A. A list of ordered steps to follow</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="B" required> B. Notes on the tools and materials needed</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="C" required> C. A guess of the grade you think you’ll get for each step</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="D" required> D. Estimated time required for each stage</label>
<br>

<p>10. What is a good reason to create a clear plan before starting to build?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="A" required> A. It guarantees a perfect outcome without any effort</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="B" required> B. It helps you identify potential problems early and guides your work effectively</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="C" required> C. Planning isn’t necessary – guessing works fine</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="D" required> D. A plan ensures you never need to ask the teacher for help</label>
