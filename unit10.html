<h2>Week 10 – Final Assessment & Reflection</h2>
<p>The final week wraps up the unit. Students submit their portfolios and completed projects for assessment. The teacher evaluates the artifact using criteria such as function, construction quality, finish and adherence to the brief. Students may give short presentations demonstrating how their solution works and summarising their project. There may be a short written quiz covering safety, tools, design process and finishing. Finally, the class reflects on what they enjoyed, what was challenging and how the skills learned relate to real‑world technology and trades.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>During the reflection circle, students share their experiences. Anya says she was nervous using tools at first but now feels confident. Brian learned the hard way to ‘measure twice’ after cutting a piece too short. Carlos discovered he enjoys the creativity in design and might take more technology subjects. The teacher notes that these skills – problem solving, planning, hands‑on tool work – mirror what professionals do.</p>
