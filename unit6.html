<h2>Week 6 – Project Construction</h2>
<p>Week 6 is assembly week. Students attach the shaped parts together using the chosen joining method. They check alignment carefully and fix small errors: holes that don’t line up may need to be enlarged slightly; pieces that are too long can be trimmed. It’s important to refer back to the design drawings during assembly to ensure the project matches the plan. If something is crooked, students learn how to straighten it under supervision. By the end of the week, the hose holder should be fully assembled and ready for finishing.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>Priya discovers the holes on her mounting plate are 2 mm closer together than the holes on her bracket. She fixes the issue by drilling one hole slightly larger so the bolt will fit through both parts. James finds his frame is lopsided after welding; with the teacher’s help he reheats the joint and gently bends it straight. These examples show how minor mistakes can be corrected during assembly.</p>
<h3>Quiz</h3>
<form class="quiz-form" data-unit="6" aria-label="Quiz">
<p>1. What assembly challenge did Priya encounter?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="A" required> A. The holes on her mounting plate did not align with those on her bracket</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="B" required> B. She lost her bolts</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="C" required> C. The metal cracked in half</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="D" required> D. The hose wouldn’t fit at all</label>
<br>

<p>2. How did Priya fix her misaligned holes?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="A" required> A. She carefully enlarged one hole with a drill so the bolt could pass through both parts</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="B" required> B. She fabricated completely new parts</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="C" required> C. She forced the bolt through with a hammer</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="D" required> D. She welded the holes shut</label>
<br>

<p>3. What is a safe and reasonable method to correct a minor misalignment in a welded frame?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="A" required> A. Under supervision, reheat or clamp and bend it carefully back into alignment</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="B" required> B. Hit it randomly with a hammer until it looks right</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="C" required> C. Ignore the problem completely</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="D" required> D. Start the entire project over again</label>
<br>

<p>4. To check that your mounting plate sits flush, you should…</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="A" required> A. Place it against a known flat surface and see whether it touches evenly</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="B" required> B. Eyeball it from a distance</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="C" required> C. Assume it is fine because you measured once</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="D" required> D. Ask someone else to hold it and hope for the best</label>
<br>

<p>5. When a component is too long during assembly, the proper correction is to…</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="A" required> A. Mark the excess, carefully cut or file it off, then check the fit again</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="B" required> B. Bend it until it fits into place</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="C" required> C. Ignore it and force parts together</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="D" required> D. Throw it away and avoid using a support</label>
<br>

<p>6. Is it normal to encounter small issues while assembling a project?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="A" required> A. Yes – troubleshoot calmly and fix them as they arise</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="B" required> B. No – everything should fit perfectly without adjustment</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="C" required> C. You should panic when anything goes wrong</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="D" required> D. Any issue means the project is ruined</label>
<br>

<p>7. Why should you continuously reference your design drawings while assembling?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="A" required> A. To ensure parts are in the correct orientation and assembled in the right order</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="B" required> B. Because teachers mark you based on how often you look at them</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="C" required> C. It isn’t important; once you start you can forget the plan</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="D" required> D. So you have something to do when bored</label>
<br>

<p>8. If your holder wobbles after bolting the parts together, what can you do to improve stability?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="A" required> A. Tighten all nuts fully and use washers or lock nuts to prevent loosening</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="B" required> B. Apply another coat of paint</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="C" required> C. Accept the wobble as part of the design</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="D" required> D. Add glue to the bolts instead of tightening them</label>
<br>

<p>9. Which of the following is NOT a safe practice during assembly?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="A" required> A. Wearing eye protection when drilling or hammering</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="B" required> B. Using random objects as hammers, such as spanners or rocks</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="C" required> C. Handling sharp edges carefully or filing them smooth</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="D" required> D. Getting help to lift heavy or awkward items</label>
<br>

<p>10. By the end of Week&nbsp;6, what should you have accomplished?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="A" required> A. A fully assembled hose holder that is ready for finishing</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="B" required> B. Just a pile of individual parts</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="C" required> C. A finished, painted and mounted product</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="D" required> D. Nothing – the project is still theoretical</label>
