<h2>Week 1 – Introduction & Safety</h2>
<p>This week introduces the hose reel holder project and the foundations of metalwork. Students learn that hoses left lying around can become messy and hazardous, so their task is to design and make a wall‑mounted metal holder that keeps the hose coiled neatly. We discuss why mild steel is chosen – it’s strong, weather resistant and easy to work with compared to wood or plastic. Safety is paramount: we cover workshop rules such as always wearing safety glasses, tying back long hair, using ear and hand protection, and never operating machines without teacher permission. A safety contract is signed and a safety quiz must be passed before anyone may use the tools. Students sketch their first ideas for the holder at the end of the week.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>Alex rushes into the workshop without putting on safety glasses or clearing his bag. He grabs a piece of metal and begins drilling without asking for help or clamping the work. This scenario highlights numerous safety breaches: missing PPE, trip hazards and failing to secure the workpiece. Through Alex’s mistakes we learn the correct procedures: clear the space, wear protective gear, clamp your material and seek teacher guidance before using any machine.</p>
<h3>Quiz</h3>
<form class="quiz-form" data-unit="1" aria-label="Quiz">
<p>1. During Alex’s incident, which behaviour created the greatest risk of injury?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="A" required> A. He dropped his bag on the floor where someone could trip</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="B" required> B. He was overly excited to start</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="C" required> C. He used a machine without permission and proper PPE in a cluttered space</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="D" required> D. He sighed loudly</label>
<br>

<p>2. What should a student always do before operating any machine?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="A" required> A. Put on all required PPE and obtain the teacher’s instruction</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="B" required> B. Take a practice cut without telling anyone</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="C" required> C. Do nothing – machines are always free to use</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="D" required> D. Re‑read the project brief instead of asking questions</label>
<br>

<p>3. Which of the following is an example of unsafe workshop practice?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="A" required> A. Tying back long hair to keep it clear of tools</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="B" required> B. Leaving tools and materials cluttered around the workspace</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="C" required> C. Operating one machine at a time with supervision</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="D" required> D. Reporting hazards or injuries promptly</label>
<br>

<p>4. If you fail to clamp your workpiece when drilling, what could happen?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="A" required> A. The drill bit may wander off the mark</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="B" required> B. The metal can spin or fly out, causing injury</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="C" required> C. The hole will be perfectly centred</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="D" required> D. Both A and B can occur</label>
<br>

<p>5. Which piece of personal protective equipment is essential when drilling metal?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="A" required> A. Safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying chips</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="B" required> B. Ear muffs</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="C" required> C. A dust mask</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="D" required> D. Work gloves</label>
<br>

<p>6. Why should PPE be worn at all times in the metal workshop?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="A" required> A. It reduces the chance of injury and is mandated by safe‑work procedures</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="B" required> B. It makes you look more professional</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="C" required> C. It allows you to ignore other safety rules</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="D" required> D. There is no good reason</label>
<br>

<p>7. Why is mild steel chosen over wood or plastic for the hose holder project?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="A" required> A. Because it is strong, weather resistant and still workable by hand</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="B" required> B. Because it is always cheaper than wood</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="C" required> C. Because wood cannot be cut or shaped</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="D" required> D. There is no advantage at all</label>
<br>

<p>8. What is the main purpose of the safety test and contract before starting work?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="A" required> A. To frighten students so they will be careful</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="B" required> B. To confirm each student understands and commits to safe practices</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="C" required> C. Because paperwork is required by the syllabus</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="D" required> D. To give an easy first grade</label>
<br>

<p>9. During Week&nbsp;1, what is emphasised as the primary focus?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="A" required> A. To begin cutting and building immediately</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="B" required> B. To understand the project brief and establish workshop safety procedures</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="C" required> C. To learn advanced welding techniques</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="D" required> D. To test the finished product</label>
<br>

<p>10. Which syllabus outcome emphasises demonstrating safe, responsible use of tools in the workshop?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="A" required> A. TE4‑1DP</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="B" required> B. TE4‑3DP</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="C" required> C. TE4‑9MA</label>
